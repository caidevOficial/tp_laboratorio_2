The dragonzord lies dormant off the coast of Angel Grove for an unknown number of years, until Rita Repulsa creates her own evil ranger, she grants him the dragon dagger to use the power to summon and control the Dragonzord. But after breaking the spell, Tommy joined the rangers, keeping the dagger and control of the Dragonzord for good. With time the power of Tommy was weakening, he granted the dagger to Jason being able to summon the Dragonzord. During a crisis, Zordon infuses Tommy's Power Coin with some of his own great power, allowing him to return to the fold as the Green Ranger and reunited with the Dragonzord. Later, when Lord Zedd took over Rita and sent his monster Pirantishead to Earth, Dragonzord was corrupted a second time by the creature, which froze four of the Dinozords and turned the Dragonzord and Tyrannozord against the Power Rangers.
