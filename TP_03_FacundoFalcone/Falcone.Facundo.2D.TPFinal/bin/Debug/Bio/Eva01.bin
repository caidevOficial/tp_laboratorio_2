The EVA-01 was created by the GEHIRN organization at the Artificial Evolution Laboratory located in Hakone and designated as the Test Type.
Unlike the other units, this EVA was generated directly from Lilith, and is consequently known as Lilith's alter ego (リ リ ス の 分身, Ririsu no bunshin?).
On a physical level, the EVA-01 has the same characteristics as an Adam-based Evangelion (i.e., it is physically similar to the other units), so the exact nature of its relationship with Lilith remains a matter of debate.
Like the rest of the EVAs, the unit was created as a weapon to combat angels, and was the first Evangelion to be used in actual combat against one of them.
