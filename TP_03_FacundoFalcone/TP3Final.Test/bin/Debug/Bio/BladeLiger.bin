The Blade Liger is a very versatile Zoid, as a result, throughout history it has a large number of modifications, the most notable being the AB unit that provides an increase in speed (which is increased to 320 km / h). There is also the Multi-Set of weapons, which allows you to further increase your ability to combat at a distance. Others are the anti-CP shield, which was designed to resist the Electric Particle Cannon (seen in the Zoids anime, a multi-directional shield (seen in the manga), and high-voltage laser blades (seen in Zoids Fuzors). ).
