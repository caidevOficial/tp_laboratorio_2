Optimus Prime is a Cybertronian, an alien species of self-configuring intelligent modular robotic life forms (ex: cars and other objects), a synergistic combination of biological evolution and technological engineering. In almost all versions of Tranformers, Optimus is the leader of the Autobots, a faction of Transformers who are rivals of the Decepticons, another faction. He is defined by his strong moral character and is almost always portrayed as the main hero of the story, opposing the evil leader of the Decepticons Megatron.
