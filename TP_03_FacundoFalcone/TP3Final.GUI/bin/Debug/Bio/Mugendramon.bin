With his entire body in 100% full metal, he is the strongest and heaviest Digimon in the Digital World. He was built by synthesizing the components of many Cyborg Digimon, and it is thought that all Cyborg Digimon produced so far were nothing more than prototypes for the realization of Mugendramon. His power is at a level that overwhelms other Digimon, and he possesses an intellect that boasts unmatched performance, but he is a purely mechanical Digimon who does not share his own will. Instead, someone planted a program containing malicious intent on the DigiCore in the center of his body, and Mugendramon was supplied with the infinite power of that maliciously-filled DigiCore. His special move is super armored-class energy waves fired from his two cannons.
